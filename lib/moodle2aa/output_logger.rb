module Moodle2AA
  # Note: the public interface for Moodle2AA::Logger is really #add_warning,
  # which tries that method on the logger and then falls back to a more
  # standard #warm method.  But it really doesn't expect the logger to
  # implement the standard logger interface. Eventually it should probably be
  # renamed to something else, and this class should be renamed to just Logger
  # (once usage of the existing logger is moved over).  OR potentially they
  # could be combined so that "warn" level has special functionality.
